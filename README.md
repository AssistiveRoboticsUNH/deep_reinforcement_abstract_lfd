# Deep Reinforcement Leanring of Abstract Reasoning from Demonstrations
Madison Clark-Turner

deep_reinforcement_abstract_lfd

The following repository contains a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) architecture for use in high-level Learning from Demonstration (LfD) of human interactions. We specifically designed this network for use with an Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) social greeting behavioral intervention.

Installation
=============
The following files are necessary for running the application:

- Tensorflow-GPU
- Numpy/Scipy
- OpenCV2
- Librosa

Usage
=============

In order to train the network you must list the directory containing traing files in the form of TFRecords in: X

While training the network our system will generate a checkpoint file every 10,000 iterations. You can train the model by executing:

  python model_trainer.py

Evaluation of a model can be performed by running 
  
  python evaluator.py
  
The live system can be run after a checkpoint file has been generated by executing:
  
  roslaunch nao_full_py.launch
  roslaunch dqn.launch


Acknowledgents
=============

We borrowed code from several sources for this project:
